# ACI-Bot
A bot named ACI that can control the server host computer via Telegram


This is the implementation of my spontaneously invented idea for a bot in the Telegram messenger.
You can set it to run in the background when you start Windows. And you can also improve it and add new features.

!!!For the program to work correctly, we need to install the Telegram bot package. How to do it? Use the NuGet package manager. I use the console, so I’ll explain it on it: Open the NuGet package console and enter the command “install-package telegram.bot”. Once the package is downloaded, you can start writing your program!
