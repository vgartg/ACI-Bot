# ACI-Bot
A bot named ACI that can control the server host computer via Telegram


This is the implementation of my spontaneously invented idea for a bot in the Telegram messenger.
You can set it to run in the background when you start Windows. And you can also improve it and add new features.

Warning: For the program to work correctly, we need to install the Telegram bot package. How to do it? Use the NuGet package manager. I use the console, so I’ll explain it on it: Open the NuGet package console and enter the command “install-package telegram.bot”. Once the package is downloaded, you can start writing your program!
